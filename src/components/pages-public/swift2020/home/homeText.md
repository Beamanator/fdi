2. **Games and Timing**:

    - On **Friday (the 7th)** games start at 13:00 **sharp**. All teams have to be on the field **before** 13:00. The captains meeting will start at 13:00 sharp for 10 mins, then games will take place starting at 13:30.
    - Games last 70 mins, _no hard or soft caps_. When the time is up, finish the point. During the pool-play phase, ties are allowed. For the bracket stage, teams will play a universe point in case of a tie when time ends.
    - Breaks between games are _25 mins_.
    - There is **1 timeout** per team per half (1 min each).
    - There is **no point cap for each game**! Play until the time ends. Halftime is at 35 mins. When we reach halftime, finish the point and switch - _WITHOUT A BREAK_
    - On **Saturday (8th)** games start at 9:00 **sharp**, meaning all teams have to arrive before 9:00!
    - _Pulling time_ is limited to 60 seconds. The time starts once a point has been scored - this means players have **60 seconds** to celebrate a scored point, figure out subs, and talk strategy before the next pull is soaring!

3. **Points and Rankings (Tournament format)**:

    - This tournament is taking place in 2 stages:
        1. Pool play (round robin)
        2. Bracket play
    - During pool play, teams are split into 2 groups - Pool A and Pool B.
    - After this phase (3 rounds on Friday and 2 rounds on Saturday), the teams will be ranked from 1st to 5th in each group according to the following:
        - Win = 3 points
        - Tie = 1 point
        - Loss = 0 points
    - In case of a tie between 2 or more teams after the pool play stage, point differential will be used as a tie breaker (difference between points scored and points scored against the team).
    - If a team failed to set a line on time, the opposing team gets **one GOAL for every 2 mins they wait** on the other end of the field!!
    - On **Saturday**, starting at 12:00 (round 3), teams will go through the single knockout bracket stage [see brackets here](/swift-2020/bracket). Teams will be ranked from 1 to 10:
        - 1st - Final winners
        - 2nd - Final losers
        - 3rd - 3rd place game winners
        - 4th - 3rd place game losers
        - 5th and 6th - (based on points difference between them in the bracket stage)
        - 7th and 8th - (based on points difference between them in the bracket stage)
        - 9th - winner of 9th place game
        - 10th - loser of 9th place game
    - Please check the [pool play](/swift-2020/pool) and the [bracket](/swift-2020/bracket) tabs to see the live ranking and score of all games after each round. There will be some cool awards and fun titles at the end of the tournament, **don't miss them**!

4. **Logistics**:

    - **Bathrooms and showers**:
        - You can find these right next to the fields, and you can find more showers next to the hotel. Check the picture above to see their location, or your volunteers will help you find them.
    - **Water**:
        - There will be a big tank of water on each field filled continuously with water. Don't forget to bring your water bottle and avoid wasting plastic! ;)
    - **Snacks**:
        - There will only be a few snacks available on the field during both days, so **please bring your food and meals** each day!
    - **T-shirts**:
        - Volunteers will distribute tshirts once you arrive on the field. If you arrive late, we will try to get yours to you throughout the tournament.
        - Feel free to play with them or use your own jerseys.

5. **Gender Ratio**:

    - As we move toward proper mixed ultimate in Egypt, we are trying to enforce the correct ratio step by step in our tournaments. Therefore, we kindly ask all the teams to have **3 ladies on the field at all times**.
    - If one of your ladies is injured or if you don't have enough, discuss it with the other team before starting (spirit rules).

6. **Spirit**:

    - [Spirit of the Game](http://www.wfdf.org/sports/ultimate/161-spirit-of-the-game-) is "the mindful behaviour practiced by players worldwide prior to, during and after a game. It encompasses attitudes and skills such as good knowledge and application of the rules, fair-mindedness, safe play, and spatial awareness, clear and calm communication, and positive and respectful attitude towards teammates, fans, and opponents, in a mutual effort to protect the basic joy of play."
    - In other words, **Let's have some fun playing Ultimate and respect the other players and members of this incredible community!!**
    - We will send teams the spirit sheets that should be filled out after each game. Volunteers will help in filling them out (if needed) and making sure all statistics are calculated.
    - One **critical** feature of _spirit of the game_ is _**UNDERSTANDING**_ the rules of the game we're all playing! If you have any questions, check out the official [WFDF rules](https://rules.wfdf.org/)

7. **Sideline Games**:

    - We will have some cool sideline games and competitions for those who aren't playing! Show us your **skills** and you might win some fun awards ;)

## That's it!
