2. **Games and Timing**:

    - We want to make sure everyone has a chance to eat, throw some discs a little bit (or throw up after eating), meet teammates, and ask any questions before matches begin! After that, Flying Disc Invasion will quickly present the rules, field arrangement, and any other necessary announcements so please arrive **before 18:30**!!
    - On **Friday (the 8th)** games start at 19:15 **sharp**!
    - Games last 40 mins, _no hard or soft caps_. When the time is up, finish the point. During the pool-play phase, ties are allowed. On the 2nd Day, teams will play a universe point in case of a tie when time ends.
    - Breaks between games are _20 mins_.
    - There is **1 timeout** per team per half (1 min each).
    - There is **no point cap for each game**! Play until the time ends. Halftime is at 20 mins. When we reach halftime, finish the point and switch - _WITHOUT A BREAK_
    - On **Saturday (the 9th)**, everyone is advised to do exactly the same as we did in Friday :) _Please don't show up late!_
    - _Pulling time_ is limited to 45 seconds. The time starts once a point has been scored - this means players have only **45 seconds** to celebrate a scored point, figure out subs, and talk strategy before the next pull is soaring!
    - If you have any questions, check the agenda [here](/erupt2020/agenda)

3. **Points and Rakings - Tournament Format**:

    - There are a total of 8 teams in this tournament, and games are spread across two days of one weekend - Friday and Saturday.
    - On **Day 1**, each team will play 3 matches - one match against every other team in your pool. Each match will be 40 minutes long, with a 20 minute break between matches.
        - Here's how the point system works for this day:
            - Win = 3 match points
            - Tie = 1 match point
            - Lose = 0 match points
        - Teams will be ranked from 1st to 4th in each pool, based on the total number of _match points_ they earned during the pool play phase.
            - In case of a tie, the total goal difference for each team will be the tie breaker in Day 1.
        - There will be big break after the second match to get some snacks, play some sideline games, and take a group picture.
    - On **Day 2**, a _new format_ will take place. Every team will get to play against all teams from the other pool _except_ the team with the same pool-ranking (for example the 2nd-ranked team from pool A, will play against the 1st, 3rd, and 4th ranked teams from pool B).
        - Here's how the point system works for this day:
            - Win against 1st ranked team = 9 match points
            - Win against 2nd ranked team = 8 match points
            - Win against 3rd ranked team = 7 match points
            - Win against 4th ranked team = 6 match points
            - Losing = 0 match points
        - There will be **no ties allowed**! (play a universe point if necessary)
    - After those 3 rounds, teams will be ranked from 1 to 8 based on their _match points_ (in case of a tie, head to head is the tie breaker, then goal difference).
        - 1st and 2nd teams will play on 1st and 2nd places
        - 3rd and 4th will play on 3rd and 4th places
        - and so on...
    - We know this sounds a little complicated, but **don't worry**! All you need to do is to win, enjoy the day, and check the [ranking]() and [scores]() tabs :D
    - We are playing according all [WFDF rules](https://rules.wfdf.org/) **EXCEPT _Stall will only be to 7 seconds_**!
    - If you have any further questions about how each round will work, please feel free to drop us a message or ask on the WhatsApp group!

4. **Logistics**:

    - **Bathrooms**:
        - You can find these right next to the fields, Check the picture above to see their location, or your volunteers will help you find them.
    - **Water**:
        - The field doesn't allow getting water from outside the field because they have a supermarket there, so we will place our big tanks of water outside the field in the parking area. Don't forget to bring your water bottle and avoid wasting plastic! ;)
    - **Snacks and food**:
        - E-RUPT is a unique sporting event because it happens during Ramadan, which means players have the opportunity to eat a special meal together before we play!. The purpose of the joint meal is to both promote friendship between players in Egypt, and to celebrate the Ramadan festivities with food! Oh, and... of course... FUN!! For all the Chefs out there, impress us with your best dish and you might win something cool ;)
    - **T-shirts**:
        - Volunteers will distribute tshirts once you arrive on the field. If you arrive late, we will try to get yours to you throughout the tournament.
        - Players are obligated to either use the tournament shirts or a top with the same color during the tournament.

5. **Gender Ratio**:

    - As we move toward proper mixed ultimate in Egypt, we are trying to encourage more ladies by enforcing the correct gender ratio step by step in our tournaments. Therefore, we kindly ask all teams to have the ratio of 3 men : 2 ladies at all times, unless some players are injured of course.

6. **Spirit of the Game**:

    - [Spirit of the Game](http://www.wfdf.org/sports/ultimate/161-spirit-of-the-game-) is "the mindful behavior practiced by players worldwide prior to, during and after a game". It encompasses attitudes and skills such as good knowledge and application of the rules, fair-mindedness, safe play, and spatial awareness, clear and calm communication, and positive and respectful attitude towards teammates, fans, and opponents, in a mutual effort to protect the basic joy of play."
    - In other words, **Let's have some fun playing Ultimate and respect the other players and members of this incredible community!!**
    - There will be no spirit sheets to fill, but ERUPT is all about good spirit! Stop the game if you need to talk about the rules or self officiation skills.
    - One **critical** feature of _spirit of the game_ is _**UNDERSTANDING**_ the rules of the game we're all playing! If you have any questions, check out the official [WFDF rules](https://rules.wfdf.org/).
        - Also, its crucial to understand that other people will always often will have a different point of view on most calls. Its **OK** to disagree, as long as we always get back to the rules and communicate respectfully.

7. **Sideline Games**:

    - We will have some cool sideline games and competitions for those who aren't playing! Show us your **skills** during the big break on the first day ;)

## That's it!
