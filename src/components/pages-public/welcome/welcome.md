## Who we are

Flying Disc Invasion (FDI) is actively invading Egypt with a new sport. Which sport, you ask? Ultimate (a.k.a. Frisbee). Many people in Egypt associate Ultimate with a game to be played with your dog, or a few minutes of fun on a beach.

    Dear Reader,

        If you have never thrown a disc / Frisbee / flying saucer before,
        please do so right now. Outside or inside, day or night, right now.
        Grab a pie tin if you have to - that's how Frisbee was invented!

    Sincerely,
    - The Invaders

So what is our objective? Our objective is to invade Egypt with a new culture endorsing healthy habits via the spreading of Ultimate Frisbee and its core values of inclusion, peace, friendship and healthy living. We plan to give every Egyptian the opportunity to hold a Frisbee and experience the delight we have all felt while participating in the amazing sport.
