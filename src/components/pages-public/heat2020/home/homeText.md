1. **Fields**:

    - We have 3 fields (A, B, and C) _as shown in the picture below_. Please check the agenda and be ready on your field **before each game starts**.
    - Field dimensions are (`35 m x 100 m`).

2. **Games and Timing**:

    - We want to make sure everyone has a chance to eat, throw some discs a little bit (or throw up after eating), meet teammates, and ask any questions before matches begin! After that, Flying Disc Invasion will quickly present the rules, field arrangement, and any other necessary announcements so please arrive **before 8:15 am**!!
    - On **Friday (the 21st)** games start at 9:00 am **sharp**!
    - Games last 45 mins, _no hard or soft caps_. When the time is up, finish the point. _Note: Ties are only allowed during pool play, not during bracket matches._
    - Breaks between games are _15 mins_.
    - There is **1 timeout** per team per half (1 min each).
    - There is **no point cap for each game**! Play until the time ends. Halftime is at 20 mins. When we reach halftime, finish the point and switch - You have a 5 minute halftime break.
    - _Pulling time_ is limited to 45 seconds. The time starts once a point has been scored - this means players have only **45 seconds** to celebrate a scored point, figure out subs, and talk strategy before the next pull is soaring!
    - If you have any questions, check the agenda [here](/heat-2020/agenda)

3. **Points and Rakings - Tournament Format**:

    - There are a total of 8 teams in this tournament, all on the hottest day of the week - Friday.
    - Each team will start by playing 3 matches (over 4 rounds) - one match against every other team in your pool. Each match will be 45 minutes long, with a 15 minute break between matches.
        - Here's how the point system works for the "pool play" section:
            - Win = 3 match points
            - Tie = 1 match point
            - Lose = 0 match points
        - Teams will be ranked from 1st to 4th in each pool, based on the total number of _match points_ they earned during the pool play phase.
            - In case of a tie, head to head matches will be taken into consideration, then the total goal difference for each team will be the tie breaker.
        - There will be big break after the third round to get some snacks, play some sideline games, and take a group picture.
    - After those 4 rounds, teams will be ranked from 1 to 8 based on their _match points_, and the bracket round begins!
    - If this sounds a little complicated, **don't worry**! All you need to do is to win, enjoy the day, and check the [ranking]() and [scores]() tabs :D
    - We are playing according all [WFDF rules](https://rules.wfdf.org/).
    - If you have any further questions about how each round will work, please feel free to drop us a message!

4. **Logistics**:

    - **Bathrooms**:
        - You can find these in-between fields, on the far side away from the parking lot OR on the Hotel grounds. The hotel bathroom has lockers and showers as well, so we'd recommend using this location :) Check the picture above to see their location, or ask someone on your team to point you in the right direction.
    - **Water**:
        - We will place our big tanks of water next to each field. Don't forget to bring your water bottle and avoid wasting plastic! ;)
    - **Snacks and food**:
        - Bring your own food! There are no markets near the field, so you'll have to travel by car to reach restaurants or markets, so we recommend bringing everything you'll need for the day (and more to share ðŸ˜œ).
    - **T-shirts**:
        - Volunteers will distribute tshirts once you arrive on the field. If you arrive late, we will try to get yours to you throughout the tournament.
        - Players are obligated to either use the tournament shirts or a top with the same color during the tournament.

5. **Gender Ratio**:

    - As we move toward proper mixed ultimate in Egypt, we are trying to encourage more ladies by enforcing the correct gender ratio step by step in our tournaments. Therefore, we kindly ask all teams to have the ratio of 3 men : 2 ladies at all times, unless some players are injured of course. However, if both teams agree that they prefer a ratio of 4 men : 1 lady, go for it.

6. **Spirit of the Game**:

    - [Spirit of the Game](http://www.wfdf.org/sports/ultimate/161-spirit-of-the-game-) is "the mindful behavior practiced by players worldwide prior to, during and after a game". It encompasses attitudes and skills such as good knowledge and application of the rules, fair-mindedness, safe play, and spatial awareness, clear and calm communication, and positive and respectful attitude towards teammates, fans, and opponents, in a mutual effort to protect the basic joy of play."
    - In other words, **Let's have some fun playing Ultimate and respect the other players and members of this incredible community!!**
    - There will be no spirit sheets to fill, but HEAT is all about good spirit! Stop the game if you need to talk about the rules or self officiation skills.
    - One **critical** feature of _spirit of the game_ is _**UNDERSTANDING**_ the rules of the game we're all playing! If you have any questions, check out the official [WFDF rules](https://rules.wfdf.org/).
        - Also, it's crucial to understand that other people will often have a different point of view on calls during matches. It's **OK** to disagree, as long as we always get back to the rules and communicate respectfully.

7. **Sideline Games**:

    - We will have some cool sideline games for those who aren't playing! Show us your **skills** during the big break or while your team is resting between rounds ðŸ˜Ž

## That's it!
